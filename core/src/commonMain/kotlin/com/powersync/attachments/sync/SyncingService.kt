/**
 * Service responsible for syncing attachments between local and remote storage.
 *
 * This service handles downloading, uploading, and deleting attachments, as well as
 * periodically syncing attachment states. It ensures proper lifecycle management
 * of sync operations and provides mechanisms for error handling and retries.
 *
 * The class provides a default implementation for syncing operations, which can be
 * overridden by subclasses to customize behavior as needed.
 *
 * @property remoteStorage The remote storage implementation for handling file operations.
 * @property localStorage The local storage implementation for managing files locally.
 * @property attachmentsService The service for managing attachment states and operations.
 * @property getLocalUri A function to resolve the local URI for a given filename.
 * @property errorHandler Optional error handler for managing sync-related errors.
 * @property logger Logger instance for logging sync operations and errors.
 * @property syncThrottle The minimum duration between consecutive sync operations.
 * @property scope The coroutine scope used for managing sync operations.
