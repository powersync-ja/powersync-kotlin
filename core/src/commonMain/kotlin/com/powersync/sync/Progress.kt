 * Provides realtime progress on how PowerSync is downloading rows.
 *
 * This type reports progress by implementing [ProgressWithOperations], meaning that the [totalOperations],
 * [downloadedOperations] and [fraction] getters are available on this instance.
 * Additionally, it's possible to obtain the progress towards a specific priority only (instead of tracking progress for
 * the entire download) by using [untilPriority].
 *
 * The reported progress always reflects the status towards the end of a sync iteration (after which a consistent
 * snapshot of all buckets is available locally).
 *
 * In rare cases (in particular, when a [compacting](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/compacting-buckets)
 * operation takes place between syncs), it's possible for the returned numbers to be slightly inaccurate. For this
 * reason, [SyncDownloadProgress] should be seen as an approximation of progress. The information returned is good
 * enough to build progress bars, but not exact enough to track individual download counts.
 *
 * Also note that data is downloaded in bulk, which means that individual counters are unlikely to be updated
 * one-by-one.
