# PowerSync Native Swift SDK

This is what is used to generate the Native Swift SDK using the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK with [SKIE](https://skie.touchlab.co/). Further details about this configuration can be found in our blog [here](https://www.powersync.com/blog/using-kotlin-multiplatform-with-kmmbridge-and-skie-to-publish-a-native-swift-sdk).

We recommend the [Supabase Todo List Demo](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin-swift-demo) app as a starting point for using the Swift SDK. See the README for details to run it.
