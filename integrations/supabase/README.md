# PowerSync Supabase Connector

Convenience implementation of a backend connector that provide the connection between your application backend and the PowerSync managed database
by delegating to Supabase.

It is used to:
1. Retrieve a token to connect to the PowerSync service.
2. Apply local changes on your backend application server (and from there, to your backend database).

The connector is fairly basic, and also serves as an example for getting started.

See a step-by-step tutorial for connecting to Supabase, [here](https://docs.powersync.com/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync).
