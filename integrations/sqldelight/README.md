> [!NOTE]
> Note that this package is currently in beta.

This library integrates PowerSync with SQLDelight. This allows you run typed queries against the local database with compile-time validation. It provides the `PowerSyncDriver` class, which implements a `SqlDriver` for `SQLDelight` backed by PowerSync.

For details on using this integration, see its page on the [PowerSync documentation](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/kotlin-multiplatform/libraries/sqldelight).
