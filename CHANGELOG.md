# Changelog

## 1.0.0-BETA29 (unreleased)

* Fix potential race condition between jobs in `connect()` and `disconnect()`.
* [iOS] Fixed issue where automatic driver migrations would fail with the error:
```
Sqlite operation failure database is locked attempted to run migration and failed. closing connection
```

## 1.0.0-BETA28

* Update PowerSync SQLite core extension to 0.3.12.
* Added queing protection and warnings when connecting multiple PowerSync clients to the same database file.
* Improved concurrent SQLite connection support accross various platforms. All platforms now use a single write connection and multiple read connections for concurrent read queries.
* Added the ability to open a SQLite database given a custom `dbDirectory` path. This is currently not supported on iOS due to internal driver restrictions.
* Internaly improved the linking of SQLite for iOS.
* Enabled Full Text Search on iOS platforms.
* Added the ability to update the schema for existing PowerSync clients.
* Fixed bug where local only, insert only and view name overrides were not applied for schema tables.
* The Android SQLite driver now uses the [Xerial JDBC library](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc). This removes the requirement for users to add the jitpack Maven repository to their projects.
```diff
// settings.gradle.kts example
    repositories {
        google()
-        maven("https://jitpack.io") {
-            content { includeGroup("com.github.requery") }
-        }
        mavenCentral()
    }
```

## 1.0.0-BETA27

* Improved watch query internals. Added the ability to throttle watched queries.
* Fixed `uploading` and `downloading` sync status indicators.

## 1.0.0-BETA26

* Support bucket priorities and partial syncs.
* Android: Add ProGuard rules to prevent methods called through JNI from being minified or removed.

## 1.0.0-BETA25

* JVM: Lower minimum supported version from 17 to 8.

## 1.0.0-BETA24

* Improve internal handling of watch queries to avoid issues where updates are not being received due to transaction commits occurring after the query is run.
* Fix issue in JVM build where `columnNames` was throwing an error due to the index of the JDBC driver starting at 1 instead of 0 as in the other drivers/
* Throw and not just catch `CancellationExceptions` in `runWrappedSuspending`

## 1.0.0-BETA23

* Make `execute` and `PowerSyncTransaction` functions throwable for Swift

## 1.0.0-BETA22

* Fix `updateHasSynced` internal null pointer exception

## 1.0.0-BETA21

* Improve error handling for Swift by adding @Throws annotation so errors can be handled in Swift
* Throw PowerSync exceptions for all public facing methods

## 1.0.0-BETA20

* Add cursor optional functions: `getStringOptional`, `getLongOptional`, `getDoubleOptional`, `getBooleanOptional` and `getBytesOptional` when using the column name which allow for optional return types
* Throw errors for invalid column on all cursor functions
* `getString`, `getLong`, `getBytes`, `getDouble` and `getBoolean` used with the column name will now throw an error for non-null values and expect a non optional return type

## 1.0.0-BETA19

* Allow cursor to get values by column name e.g. `getStringOptional("id")`
* BREAKING CHANGE: If you were using `SqlCursor` from SqlDelight previously for your own custom mapper then you must now change to `SqlCursor` exported by the PowerSync module.

  Previously you would import it like this:

  ```kotlin
  import app.cash.sqldelight.db.SqlCursor
  ```

  now it has been changed to:

  ```kotlin
  import com.powersync.db.SqlCursor
  ```

## 1.0.0-BETA18

* BREAKING CHANGE: Move from async sqldelight calls to synchronous calls. This will only affect `readTransaction` and `writeTransaction`where the callback function is no longer asynchronous.

## 1.0.0-BETA17

* Add fix for Windows using JVM build

## 1.0.0-BETA16

* Add `close` method to database methods
* Throw when error is a `CancellationError` and remove invalidation for all errors in `streamingSync` catch.

* Increase maximum amount of columns from 63 to 1999

## 1.0.0-BETA14

* Add JVM compatibility
* Revert previous iOS changes as they resulted in further issues.

## 1.0.0-BETA13

## 1.0.0-BETA11

* Update version to fix deployment issue of previous release

## 1.0.0-BETA10

* Change Swift package name from `PowerSync` to `PowerSyncKotlin`

## 1.0.0-BETA9

* Re-enable SKIE `SuspendInterop`
* Move transaction functions out of `PowerSyncTransactionFactory` to avoid threading issues in Swift SDK

## 1.0.0-BETA8

## 1.0.0-BETA7

* Update supabase connector to use supabase-kt version 3
* Handle Postgres error codes in supabase connector

## 1.0.0-BETA6

* Fix error being thrown in iOS app launch

## 1.0.0-BETA4

* Fix sync status being reset when `update` function is run

## 1.0.0-BETA3

* Add `waitForFirstSync` function - which resolves after the initial sync is completed
* Upgrade to Kotlin 2.0.20 - should not cause any issues with users who are still on Kotlin 1.9
* Upgrade `powersync-sqlite-core` to 0.3.0 - improves incremental sync performance
* Add client sync parameters - which allows you specify sync parameters from the client https://docs.powersync.com/usage/sync-rules/advanced-topics/client-parameters-beta
```kotlin
val params = JsonParam.Map(
  mapOf(
    "name" to JsonParam.String("John Doe"),
    "age" to JsonParam.Number(30),
    "isStudent" to JsonParam.Boolean(false)
  )
)

connect(
...

## 1.0.0-BETA1

* Improve API by changing from Builder pattern to simply instantiating the database `PowerSyncDatabase`
  E.g. `val db = PowerSyncDatabase(factory, schema)`
* Use callback context in transactions
  E.g. `db.writeTransaction{ ctx -> ctx.execute(...) }`
* Removed unnecessary expiredAt field
* Added table max column validation as there is a hard limit of 63 columns
* Moved SQLDelight models to a separate module to reduce export size
* Replaced default Logger with [Kermit Logger](https://kermit.touchlab.co/) which allows users to more easily use and/or change Logger settings
