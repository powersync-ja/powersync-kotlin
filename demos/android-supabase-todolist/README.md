# PowerSync + Supabase Android Demo: Todo List App

This is a simple to-do list application demonstrating the use of the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK's Android package in an [Android Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/android-overview.html) project with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## Set up your Supabase and PowerSync project

To run this demo, you need a Supabase and PowerSync project. Detailed instructions for integrating PowerSync with Supabase can be found in [the integration guide](https://docs.powersync.com/integration-guides/supabase).

Follow this guide to:
1. Create and configure a Supabase project.
2. Create a new PowerSync instance, connecting to the database of the Supabase project. See instructions [here](https://docs.powersync.com/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync#connect-powersync-to-your-supabase).
3. Deploy sync rules.

### Opting in to priorities

If you want to use the example with [bucket priorities](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/use-case-examples/prioritized-sync),
you can adopt the following sync rules instead of the ones suggested by the simpler integration guide:

```YAML
bucket_definitions:
  all_lists:
    priority: 1
    parameters: select request.user_id() as "user"
    data:
      - select * from lists where owner_id = bucket."user"

  list_items:
    # Separate bucket per list
    parameters: select id as list_id from lists where owner_id = request.user_id()
    data:
      - select * from todos where list_id = bucket.list_id
```

The project will work with both sync rules, but giving lists a higher priority allows updates to be synchronized before
all items have been received.

## Configure project in Android Studio

1. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin.git```
2. Open `powersync-kotlin/demos/android-supabase-todolist` in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle (this should happen automatically, or choose File > Sync project with Gradle Files).
4. Insert your Supabase project URL, Supabase Anon Key, and PowerSync instance URL into the `local.properties` file:

```bash
# local.properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk

# Enter your PowerSync instance URL
POWERSYNC_URL=https://foo.powersync.journeyapps.com
# Enter your Supabase project's URL and public anon key (Project settings > API)
SUPABASE_URL=https://foo.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=foo
```

## Run the app

Choose a run configuration for the Android app in Android Studio and run it.

## To include PowerSync in your own Android app make sure to do the following:

1. Add `jitpack` as a repository to your `settings.gradle.kts` so that the underlying android sqlite package can be downloaded:

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        maven("https://jitpack.io")
        ...
    }
}
```

2. Add the PowerSync SDK to your project by adding the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin

dependencies {
    implementation("com.powersync:core-android:$powersyncVersion")
    ...
}
```

If you want to use the Supabase Connector, also add the following to `dependencies`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.powersync:connector-supabase:$powersyncVersion")
    ...
}
```
